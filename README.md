This repository showcases hands-on cybersecurity work completed as part of my Google Cybersecurity Analyst training.  
It focuses on security operations, incident response, risk assessment, and compliance fundamentals.  
Artifacts include SOC-style incident tickets, network traffic analysis, audits, vulnerability assessments, and access control exercises.  
All files are sanitized and structured to reflect real-world SOC and GRC workflows.  
This portfolio is intended for entry-level SOC Analyst and Security Compliance / GRC roles.
